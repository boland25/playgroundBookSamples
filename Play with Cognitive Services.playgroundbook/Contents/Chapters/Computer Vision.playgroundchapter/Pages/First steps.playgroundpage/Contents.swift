 # Describe your picture!
 
 It's time to get life into our app! Want to get your picture described by a remote service? Yes? YES? So get ready - and get to know the * *drumroooooll* * **COGNITIVE SERVICES**!
 
 We will start with the Computer Vision API. So let's see, what the "computer" can "see" on our image.

 Every part of the description of the picture will be returned with a certain confidence. A good value is 0.85 for nice fitting results. But go a head and play around with this value and see, with what funky descriptions the "computer" may come along

 * callout(What did we learn?):
 Wonderful! So you just called your first API from the Cognitive Services Suite. The Computer Vision API. If you want to have a detailed look at the documentation - where you can find further examples - visit the dedicated [Computer Vision documentation](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/computer-vision-api).

//: Enough of just describing photos. Let's catch a smile and let the API know! Let's rock on and continue by [using the Emotion API](@next)!
